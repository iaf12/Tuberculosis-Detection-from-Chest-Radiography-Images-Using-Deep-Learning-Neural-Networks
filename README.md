# Tuberculosis-Detection-from-Chest-Radiography-Images-Using-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks

### This project had been done for my bachelor thesis. which is going to be published after more improving with the models reliability in no time.

<p>Tuberculosis is a crucial issue where a lot of space available to improve the treatment quality. we can use our model to detect disease earlier after classifying the Chest X Ray (CXR) image of patients.</p>

###Dataset:
<p>In this Project, a private dataset (200 CXR images) is used which has been collected from ICDDR, B. It has two classes (Normal and TB). Each class has 100 x-ray images. Two data processing approaches are used (a) Cropped, (b) Cropped + CLAHE. Then, to train the models, the datasets are partitioned into Train (70%), Test (15%) and Validation (15%) folders to train and test our DNN models.</p>
