# Tuberculosis-Detection-from-Chest-Radiography-Images-Using-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks

## This project had been done for my bachelor thesis. which is going to be published after more improving with the models reliability in no time.

Tuberculosis is a crucial issue where a lot of space available to improve the treatment quality. we can use our model to detect disease earlier after classifying the Chest X Ray (CXR) image of patients.
